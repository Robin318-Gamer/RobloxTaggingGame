### **Phase 2: Add the Scripts to Your Game**

#### **What Are Scripts and Where Do They Go?**
- **ModuleScript**: A reusable code file (like a library)
- **Script**: Runs on the server (controls the game)
- **LocalScript**: Runs on each player‚Äôs computer (controls the UI)

#### **Step 5: Add GameConfig (ModuleScript)**
1. In Explorer, right-click **ReplicatedStorage**
2. Click **Insert Object** ‚Üí **ModuleScript**
3. Rename it to `GameConfig` (right-click, choose Rename)
4. Click the new `GameConfig` to open it
5. Delete all the default code in the script
6. Open `GameConfig.lua` from this project (in Notepad or VS Code)
7. Copy everything (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)
8. Paste into the Studio script (Ctrl+V)
9. Press **Ctrl+S** to save

#### **Step 6: Add SoundManager (ModuleScript)**
1. Repeat the above steps, but name it `SoundManager`
2. Copy all code from `SoundManager.lua` and paste it in

#### **Step 7: Add GameManager (Script)**
1. Right-click **ServerScriptService**
2. Click **Insert Object** ‚Üí **Script**
3. Rename it to `GameManager`
4. Delete all default code
5. Copy all code from `GameManager.lua` and paste it in

#### **Step 8: Add GameClient (LocalScript)**
1. Expand **StarterPlayer** in Explorer
2. Expand **StarterPlayerScripts**
3. Right-click **StarterPlayerScripts**
4. Click **Insert Object** ‚Üí **LocalScript**
5. Rename it to `GameClient`
6. Delete all default code
7. Copy all code from `GameClient.lua` and paste it in

**Tip:** If you make a mistake, you can always delete the script and start again.

### **Phase 3: Test Your Game in Studio**

#### **Step 9: Set Debug Settings for Easy Testing**
Open your `GameConfig` ModuleScript in Studio and make sure this section looks like this:
```lua
GameConfig.Debug = {
    Enabled = true,
    ShowPlayerPositions = true,
    QuickStart = true,  -- Skips waiting for min players
    ShowMapGeneration = true
}
```
This makes testing much easier!

#### **Step 10: Run Your Game**
1. Click the **Home** tab at the top
2. Click the big **Play** button (or press F5)
3. Wait for the game to load
4. If you see a green platform and a red room in the middle, it‚Äôs working!
5. If you see errors, click **View** ‚Üí **Output** to see what went wrong

#### **Step 11: Test with Multiple Players**
1. Click the small arrow under the **Play** button
2. Choose **Start Server and Players**
3. Set **Players: 2** (or more)
4. Click **Start**
5. Two game windows will open (one for each player)
6. Make sure both players see the UI and the game starts automatically

**Tip:** You can move the player with WASD keys and use the mouse to look around.

### **Phase 4: Troubleshooting (If You Get Stuck)**

**‚ùå Scripts don‚Äôt work?**
- Double-check you put each script in the right place (see Phase 2)
- Make sure you deleted the default code in each script
- Check the Output window (View ‚Üí Output) for red error messages

**‚ùå Map doesn‚Äôt appear?**
- Look for a part called `BasePlatform` in Workspace
- If it‚Äôs missing, check that GameManager is in ServerScriptService

**‚ùå UI doesn‚Äôt show up?**
- Make sure GameClient is a LocalScript in StarterPlayerScripts
- Check for errors in Output

**‚ùå Game doesn‚Äôt start?**
- Make sure QuickStart is set to true in GameConfig
- You need at least 2 players for the game to start

**Still stuck?**
- Try deleting and re-adding the script
- Ask for help on the [DevForum](https://devforum.roblox.com/)

### **Phase 5: Get Ready to Publish Your Game**

#### **Step 12: Turn Off Debug Settings for Real Players**
When you‚Äôre happy with your game, open `GameConfig` and change this section:
```lua
GameConfig.Debug = {
    Enabled = false,        -- No debug messages
    ShowPlayerPositions = false,
    QuickStart = false,     -- Wait for real players
    ShowMapGeneration = false
}

4. Set to **Public** when you want everyone to play, or **Private** for testing

#### **Step 14: Final Testing**
1. Set `QuickStart = false` in GameConfig
2. Click **Play** and make sure the game waits for enough players
3. Play through a full game to check everything works

### **Phase 6: Publish and Share Your Game!**

#### **Step 15: Publish to Roblox**
1. Click **File** ‚Üí **Publish to Roblox**

## üéÆ Game Configuration Reference (For Beginners)


### **Key Settings You Can Adjust:**

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `MinPlayers` | 2 | Minimum players to start |
| `MaxPlayers` | 10 | Maximum server capacity |
| `PreparationTime` | 30s | Ghost lockdown duration |
| `GameTime` | 300s | Main game duration |
| `TagDistance` | 10 | How close to tag players |
| `MapSize` | 200 | Size of generated map |


### **Tips for Balancing the Game:**
- **Too easy for ghost?** Decrease `TagDistance` or `GameTime`
- **Too hard for players?** Increase hiding spots or `PreparationTime`
- **Games too long?** Reduce `GameTime`
- **Not enough players joining?** Lower `MinPlayers`

## üîß Advanced Customization (Optional)

### **Adding Custom Maps:**
Replace the `MapGenerator:GenerateRandomMap()` function to load your custom map instead of generating random terrain.

### **Custom Sounds:**
Upload audio files to Roblox and replace the sound IDs in `GameConfig.Sounds`.

### **UI Themes:**
Modify colors in `GameConfig.UI.Colors` to match your preferred theme.

## üìû Support & Debugging


### **Debug Output Messages:**
Enable `GameConfig.Debug.Enabled = true` to see detailed logging:
- `"Player joined: [PlayerName]"`
- `"Game state changed to: [State]"`
- `"Ghost selected: [PlayerName]"`
- `"Map generation completed"`


### **Performance Tips:**
- Keep `MaxPlayers` ‚â§ 10 for smooth performance
- Monitor part count if adding custom map elements
- Test on mobile devices for broader accessibility
